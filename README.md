Hex Grids
=========

- `coordinates` (@bockit/hex-coordinates): Convert pixel coordinates to hex coordinates and vice versa. Supports flat and pointy topped hexagons.
- `round` (@bockit/hex-round): Round hex coordinates to their nearest hex. Support cube and axial grid systems.
- `storage` (@bockit/hex-storage): Store and retrieve values based on the q and r coordinates in a hex grid.

A lot of the logic is courtesy of [redblobgames hex grid reference][rbghex]
